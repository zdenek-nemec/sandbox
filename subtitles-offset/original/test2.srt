1
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,843
Dial the gate! Dial it now!

2
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:21,063
I swear, sir, I thought
they wanted to smoke a peace pipe.

4
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,122
- Morning.
- Morning.

5
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,543
- When is SG-1 due back?
- Hour and 22 minutes from now, sir.

6
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,754
- Tell Major Carter I have a message.
- Yes, sir.

7
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,757
Incoming wormhole.

8
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,638
Receiving SG-1's identification code.

9
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,308
It's a code red, sir.
Looks like they're under fire.

10
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,520
Defence unit and medical team
to the gate room.

11
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,565
Opening the iris.

12
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,457
Next.

13
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,837
I've been shot.

14
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:35,637
Some sort of... tranquilliser.

15
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,268
Steady pulse.
He's just unconscious, sir.

16
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:46,398
Classify P2X- 374 as unfriendly, sir.
Fairly primitive from the looks of it.

17
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,693
I presume Captain Hagman
will need to be reassigned?

18
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,864
- I'd say so, sir.
- We'll debrief in one hour. Dismissed.

19
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,116
Major.

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,662
I got a call this morning
from area 51. It's done.

21
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,798
Jonas.

22
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,720
Major. How's Colonel O'Neill?

23
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,182
Partially torn ligament in his knee.
He'll be OK.

24
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,310
- Captain Hagman?
- He'll make a full recovery.

25
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,395
What does that make? Eight now?

26
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,065
Nine, if you count the two hours
Captain Matthison lasted.

27
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,402
Right. So there's no need
for Ancient Babylonian?

28
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,573
Not exactly.
Do you think you can spare a few hours?

29
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,993
- Sure. For what?
- You've been here three months.

30
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,955
General Hammond thought
you might finally like to leave the base.

31
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,460
Yes. That would be great.
Where we going?

32
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:15,172
- Nevada.
- Clear skies, 73 degrees.

33
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,842
There are at least
500 other channels, you know.

34
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,595
But this one, this one is fantastic.

35
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,682
You have all of your weather
from all over your planet right here.

36
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:30,437
Even long- range forecasts.
It's like... predicting the future.

37
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:35,984
- Well, there is some science involved.
- I know. What's in Nevada?

38
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,781
- Do you like surprises?
- Sure. I love'em.

39
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,035
Hey, Major?

40
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,541
How do I know what colour to wear?

41
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,173
We call each other
every morning.

42
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,490
I thought you'd like to see the prototype
as soon as it was completed.

43
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,285
Wow. You're way ahead of schedule.

44
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,206
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

45
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:36,211
Oh, no, no, no, no.

46
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,380
I'm sorry?

47
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,466
Dr Larry Murphy, Colonel Jack O'Neill.

48
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:47,723
This is Teal'c. This is Jonas Quinn, the
man who introduced us to the naquadria.

49
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,558
Pleasure to meet you.

50
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:53,312
In case there was some doubt
about what I was just saying: no.

51
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,772
I'm sorry. To what exactly?

52
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,985
O'Neill believes you are going
to request that we test- fly this aircraft.

53
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,238
Of course. Sir, I wasn't around for it,

54
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:07,451
but we're all familiar with your experience
with the X- 302's predecessor.

55
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,120
Are you, now? Really?

56
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:13,790
Well, sir, I can tell you that
this is a very different ship.

57
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:19,505
Sir, the X- 301 was a modified glider.
Now, while many of the 302's systems

58
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:23,634
were retroengineered from
Goa'uld technology, it is human built.

59
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,553
So was the Titanic.

60
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,890
This could be the most important
breakthrough for Earth

61
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,518
since the discovery of the Stargate.

62
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,062
- Why's that?
- It has four sets of engines:

63
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:39,775
air- breathing jets, modified aerospikes
for high altitude, and a rocket booster.

64
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,777
You said four, right?

65
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,572
The fourth engine is
a hyperspace- window generator.

66
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,659
Even Goa'uld gliders
can't enter hyperspace.

67
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,204
They're too small to carry
the Goa'uld version of the generator.

68
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,916
- Ours are much more compact.
- Because of the naquadria.

69
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,460
Jonas, this was possible because of you.

70
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:03,006
It's still a few weeks away from a practical
test, but all indications look good.

71
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,259
If this performs the way it should,

72
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:11,098
the X- 302 will be the first human- built
spacecraft capable of interstellar travel.

73
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,689
The deal made by our...

74
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,985
I am aware of every aspect
of the arrangement, Colonel.

75
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,153
Jack, come in.

76
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:34,496
Colonel, you know Colonel Chekov,
the Russian envoy to the SGC.

77
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,789
We've met.

78
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,209
Colonel Chekov feels that
as a symbol of our joint efforts,

79
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:42,838
a Russian officer
should be assigned to join SG-1.

80
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,384
Over my rotting corpse, sir.

81
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,927
Colonel?

82
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,182
I'm sorry. Did I say that out loud?

83
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:57,436
I said I would discuss it with you
and that you would give it careful thought.

84
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,065
And that I will, General.
But I'm still pretty sure I'll say "Bite me. "

85
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,445
Colonel, would you excuse us?

86
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,405
General.

87
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,077
So sorry.

88
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:24,505
I'm sorry, General. You know
I mean no disrespect toward you.

89
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:28,133
I know. I should have reprimanded you
in front of the colonel,

90
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,802
but I agree with
your sentiments in this case.

91
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:34,515
Who decided every team
has to have four people?

92
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,558
No one says they do.

93
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:41,230
But Daniel Jackson provided SG-1 with
invaluable knowledge, linguistic skills,

94
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,775
and, in my opinion,
a very beneficial viewpoint.

95
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,653
One I think is important
enough to replace.

96
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,989
- But not with a Russian.
- I agree.

97
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,117
But my patience is starting
to wear thin on this matter.

98
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:58,372
I think I've given you a great deal
of latitude lately, given the situation.

99
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,290
- Sir...
- Jack.

100
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,877
You're off the mission list anyway
until that knee fully heals.

101
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,463
Use the time to try
and get some perspective.

102
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,216
Find someone qualified
you can work with.

103
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,887
I'll have all available personnel files
forwarded to you. Dismissed.

104
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,560
Yes, sir.

105
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,112
- Major.
- Yeah?

106
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,991
I realised I never actually thanked you
for letting me see the X- 302.

107
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,619
Well, General Hammond
ordered me to invite you.

108
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,038
I'm glad the naquadria's gonna be useful.

109
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:44,084
- Yeah, looks that way.
- Can I see the plans for it?

110
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,294
Yeah.

111
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:49,631
Hammond says I should give you what
you want regarding the naquadria, so...

112
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,633
He's a man of his word.

113
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:55,554
I doubt it'll mean much to you
without an understanding of our science.

114
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,016
Maybe you can recommend
some related reading.

115
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,144
Yeah, sure. I'll type up a list.

116
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,854
Great. Thanks.

117
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:12,654
You know, Major... I'm as physically fit
as anybody on this base,

118
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:16,158
and I've committed to memory
almost all of Dr Jackson's work.

119
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,075
Everything?

120
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,164
According to the tests, I am able to learn
much quicker than the average human.

121
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,416
All very interesting, but...

122
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,711
I wanna join you, explore other planets,

123
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:32,716
discover new worlds, new cultures,
help rid the galaxy of the Goa'uld.

124
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,843
I get the picture.

125
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:38,555
I can't stay here the rest of my life.
I can't go back to my planet.

126
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,184
They don't realise the threat.
I can help them by helping you.

127
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,145
I can also help finish
what Dr Jackson started.

128
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:50,817
Jonas... I understand
why you wanna join SG-1.

129
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:57,241
And I'm sorry, but...
I just don't see it happening.

130
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,804
He trusts you.

131
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,807
I believe it is you he must learn to trust.

132
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,396
How can he learn to trust me
if he won't even speak to me?

133
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:32,776
He holds me responsible
for what happened to... Dr Jackson.

134
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:36,071
I believe you are correct.

135
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:44,955
How can I even begin to make up for it
if he won't give me the chance?

136
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,921
- This really a sport on this planet?
- Are you injured?

137
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:54,882
It'll take more than that.

138
00:11:54,965 --> 00:12:01,054
Tell you what, if I knock you down,
you gotta talk to Colonel O'Neill for me.

139
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,016
OK.

140
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,318
I'm OK. I wasn't ready.

141
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,824
I'm ready now.

142
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,220
Little snack?

143
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:50,312
The universities of this great nation
are getting lax in their admissions.

144
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,397
To whom are you referring?

145
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:56,276
I can be as diplomatic
and open- minded as anyone.

146
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,446
Hammond is insisting SG-1
needs a sociopolitical nerd

147
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,991
to offset our overwhelming coolness.

148
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,994
Have you considered Jonas Quinn?

149
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,249
Now, I know you've been practising,
but I still can't tell.

150
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:13,085
Is that a joke?

151
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,546
He wishes to fight against the Goa'uld.

152
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,965
He's an ali...

153
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,344
.. en.

154
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,347
He's an alien.

155
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:29,560
I don't think we need
someone else on the team.

156
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,020
You, Carter and I can
handle things just fine.

157
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:35,315
- You learned to trust me, O'Neill.
- That's different.

158
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,651
I do not believe it is.

159
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,821
Like me, Jonas Quinn
may be an alien to this world,

160
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,323
but he is committed to the Tauri's cause.

161
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,869
That doesn't mean I want him
watching my back in battle, OK?

162
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:50,205
Unscheduled incoming traveller.

163
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,217
Bra'tac, what's up?

164
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,179
Tek matte, Master Bra'tac.

165
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:09,391
I am sorry I did not come sooner, Teal'c.
Drey'auc is gravely ill.

166
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,645
No need to ask. Go.

167
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,778
- I didn't know he had a wife.
- Yeah. And a son, Rya'c.

168
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,616
They were banished from their home
on Chulak when Teal'c defected.

169
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,620
At one point, Apophis brainwashed Rya'c
and tried to use him against us.

170
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,624
- Bra'tac's been looking out for them.
- Why didn't Teal'c bring them here?

171
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,126
Drey'auc wanted
to stay with her own people,

172
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,588
and Teal'c was away on missions
most of the time anyway.

173
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,799
He tries to get home as often he can,
but it's not easy for him.

174
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,345
- You'd never know.
- Teal'c's not exactly an open book.

175
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,972
Still, I'm usually better at reading people.

176
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,682
Major!

177
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,268
Why was I not informed about the X- 302?

178
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:58,982
For example, it might not be that obvious
to everyone, but he is actually very upset.

179
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,028
How did you find out about the X- 302?

180
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,281
That is not the issue.
Article 3A clearly states...

181
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,784
The X- 302 has nothing
to do with the Stargate.

182
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:13,288
The naquadria being used to power
the hyperspace- window generator was...

183
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:16,708
- Unauthorised incoming wormhole.
- What now?

184
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,711
I'll take anything over this.

185
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:33,767
We're not receiving an IDC, sir.
In fact, there's nothing, sir.

186
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,521
What's up?

187
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,982
Apparently, nothing.

188
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,568
- Nothing?
- So it would seem.

189
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,030
- That's a twist.
- Gate's functioning.

190
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:51,910
- We're looking at an incoming wormhole.
- But nothing is incoming?

191
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:55,789
- As far as I can tell.
- The Goa'uld used that tactic before.

192
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:01,086
To block our escape while
they attacked in ships. Yeah.

193
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,839
Nothing from deep- space watch either.

194
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,966
This doesn't make any sense.

195
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,219
To keep a wormhole open,
you have to send something through -

196
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,388
a radio signal, anything.

197
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,849
We're getting... nothing.

198
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:19,354
- Figure it out, Major. I'll call the president.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:24,526
Don't look at me. I got nothin'.

200
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,914
As you see, conditions are harsh.

201
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,500
But they have been safe here.

202
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,961
Teal'c They must be moved
to the new outpost built by the Tauri.

203
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,506
All Jaffa who support
our cause are welcome.

204
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,300
Drey'auc is in
no state to be moved.

205
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,093
Teal'c Why did you wait?

206
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,722
As it is, I have brought
you here against her wishes.

207
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,308
She has always been proud.

208
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:05,025
She refused to accept the new symbiote.

209
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,902
- Was one procured?
- No.

210
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:11,532
She did not wish us to sacrifice
the life of another Jaffa to save her own,

211
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:15,577
even one who still foolishly
worshipped the false gods.

212
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:18,163
- We would all choose the same.
- In the past...

213
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:24,503
It is not the past. The dissent we have
bred has brought about many changes.

214
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:29,424
The Goa'uld no longer trust the Jaffa
priests with their young as they once did.

215
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,849
Rya'c.

216
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,978
You dare show your face here?

217
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,107
She's dead because of you.

218
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:57,452
- Could it be a malfunction?
- It's possible, but highly unlikely.

219
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:01,582
Chances are, somebody dialled
Earth from an offworld gate.

220
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,250
Wrong number?

221
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,128
Normally, the gate
shuts down after a short time

222
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:10,257
if nothing's entering the event horizon
from the outgoing location.

223
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,885
So what do we do?

224
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,761
We wait.

225
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:19,016
To my knowledge, no one's sustained
a wormhole for longer than 38 minutes.

226
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:23,353
Could whoever's behind this redial
our gate just to keep us from using it?

227
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:28,650
I've programmed the computer to dial
the Alpha site after the wormhole expires.

228
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:34,406
We'll be able to recall our teams and
hopefully contact someone who can help.

229
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,754
It's still on.

230
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,757
38 minutes, give or take a few seconds.

231
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,097
How many is a few?

232
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,433
OK, now we have a problem.

233
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,796
She believed in you...
in the fight you have chosen.

234
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,884
As you once did.

235
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:21,513
How long were we to live like this?
Are we all to die like she did?

236
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:24,975
Nothing has changed.
The Goa'uld can be defeated.

237
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:30,439
As long as we must carry symbiotes, we
will depend on the Goa'uld for our lives.

238
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,525
We will find a way to be free.

239
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:41,492
My mother will never know this freedom
you speak of. She had no choice.

240
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,953
You brought this upon her.
You chose for the both of us.

241
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:52,085
Now, as any warrior would,
I choose to avenge her death.

242
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,007
Everything I have done
I have done for you.

243
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,303
Then I am ashamed. For you have
done nothing but bring pain and misery

244
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,681
and, above all,
false hope to countless Jaffa.

245
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:09,102
Then fire your weapon.

246
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:39,383
There's a rise in power being retained
by the gate's internal capacitors of 0. 1*/*.

247
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,928
While there's an open wormhole,
the value fluctuates anyway.

248
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,597
Not for the last 12 minutes, it hasn't.

249
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,726
Go to gate diagnostic screen four.

250
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,525
Normal. No incoming energy readings.

251
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,194
Increase sensitivity by 50 per cent.

252
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:04,908
What was that?

253
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:09,163
Could be interference in the line
between the gate and computer.

254
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:13,083
There it is again.
Increase sensitivity by 200 per cent.

255
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:16,336
That's well within
the margin of error for the sensors.

256
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,839
I know. Try it anyway.

257
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,558
It's a small anomaly, but it could be
contributing to the power build- up.

258
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,227
- But...
- Errors are random, Lieutenant.

259
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:34,897
Whatever this is, it has a distinct pattern.

260
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,607
Right.

261
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:47,242
Fight! Or do you not consider me
a worthy opponent?

262
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:55,792
You should be glad he does not,
for if he did, he would snap you in half.

263
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,879
You have become skilled, Rya'c,

264
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:02,549
but a true Jaffa warrior
does not let grief cloud his judgment.

265
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:05,886
I choose my opponent
as foolishly as he chose his.

266
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:09,181
Teal'c chose your mother's fate
no more than he chose his own.

267
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:14,311
- We are all victims of the Goa'uld.
- No, Master Bra'tac. Rya'c is correct.

268
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,606
I have failed both he and his mother.

269
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:21,944
The boy passes judgment without
having fought a single battle. Hm?

270
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:26,448
Fighting a war that appears unwinnable
does not make one's cause less noble.

271
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:29,785
He cares more for dying
than for his own flesh and blood.

272
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:34,039
So must all Jaffa, if any of us
are ever to taste freedom.

273
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:53,016
We've detected an energy build- up. It's
being transmitted through the wormhole.

274
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,145
Our sensors aren't calibrated
to measure something this small.

275
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,773
- The iris appears to be holding.
- Yes, sir.

276
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:04,945
It's likely slowing the energy transfer,
but it's not stopping it completely.

277
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:08,365
- Doesn't sound so bad.
- Actually, sir, it is.

278
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,326
The gate itself is
one giant superconductor,

279
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,204
capable of absorbing
huge amounts of energy.

280
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:18,041
If that capacity is exceeded,
the naqahdah the Stargate's made up of

281
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,669
will become charged and could explode.

282
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,629
How long?

283
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:26,258
A few days, maybe less.
We're calculating it right now.

284
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,844
Is there any good news?

285
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,890
Just bad and worse, sir.

286
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:35,851
We're talking about a blast
2, 000 to 3, 000 megatons.

287
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,770
Enough to take out Colorado.

288
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:43,442
The resulting environmental effects
could destroy all life on Earth.

289
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,570
There's worse?

290
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,574
We have no idea how to stop it.

291
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,892
Shel mak. Shel assah.

292
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:06,233
Let him mourn.

293
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:09,361
- He has grown to hate me.
- He does not.

294
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:12,364
Nor does he truly believe
our cause is futile.

295
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,659
Drey'auc would not allow it.

296
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:18,245
Why does he speak as he does?

297
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,415
Self- doubt.

298
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:26,670
Since the day Apophis brainwashed him,
he has believed his own mind is weak.

299
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,714
It is not true.

300
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:30,799
You were no different at his age.

301
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:35,304
After the death of your father
at the hands of Cronus,

302
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:38,056
fear almost consumed you.

303
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,394
Like Rya'c, it was desire for vengeance
that gave you strength.

304
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:46,148
- Rya'c misplaces his blame.
- He directs his malice towards you

305
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:49,651
because he believes you doubt him
as much as he doubts himself.

306
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,571
Why would he believe such a thing?

307
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:58,285
Because you are his father and
you have not told him otherwise.

308
00:27:55,801 --> 00:28:00,889
Not so long ago...
I was captured in battle,

309
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:05,435
and Apophis took control of my mind.

310
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:12,192
He made me believe that
I was once again his loyal first prime.

311
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,573
And I turned on my friends
who trusted me.

312
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:20,617
Were it not for Bra'tac
and the rite of M'al Sharran,

313
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:25,289
I would have died...
believing that Apophis was my god.

314
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:35,132
Whether you believe in me
or what I have chosen to do

315
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:40,053
does not change the fact that
I have never doubted your heart, Rya'c.

316
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:47,394
You need never win back my trust,
my son, for you have never lost it.

317
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:03,243
- Shouldn't we cut power?
- Won't do any good.

318
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,413
Incoming wormholes
draw their energy from the offworld.

319
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:09,791
Major Carter wants
to monitor the gate through feedback.

320
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:15,088
We can't use the Russian gate because
there's already an established wormhole.

321
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:24,765
Energy build- up has reached 18 per cent.

322
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,267
There has to be a way
to drain the capacitors.

323
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:31,688
- Still sexy as ever, I see.
- What are you doing here?

324
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:36,235
There's no point in building naqahdah
reactors for Russia if there's no Russia.

325
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:39,530
The Pentagon thought
you might need some help.

326
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,448
Not from you.

327
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:47,120
OK. Well, then, I'll get a coffee
and a doughnut and wait for the big bang.

328
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,790
- That's just what I needed.
- Major.

329
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,085
Carter.

330
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,172
This wouldn't be a problem
if you had a working alien ship.

331
00:29:57,256 --> 00:30:00,717
Hey! I didn't wreck it. The Goa'uld did.

332
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,346
And we barely escaped with our lives.

333
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,308
What good is being a part of this
so- called Protected Planets Treaty

334
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,936
if you can't even reach
the Asgard when attacked?

335
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:15,566
Excuse me, sirs. I just got off the phone
with Dr Murphy at area 51.

336
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:19,278
He says he can have the X- 302
ready to go in six hours.

337
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:23,782
- I thought it was weeks away from a test.
- We've tried everything else we can.

338
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:27,161
Our only chance is
if we can contact the Asgard.

339
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:30,080
I'd like to volunteer, sir.

340
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:33,750
I'll go too, sir.

341
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:38,380
- You sure you're up for it, Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

342
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:42,885
I'll have transport prepped
and ready in 20 minutes.

343
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:25,135
- Shaq'rel.
- Teal'c.

344
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:28,764
- It has been too long, old friend.
- It is fortunate you are here.

345
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:31,517
I have brought word to Bra'tac
so he might warn you.

346
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,895
- Of what?
- The Tauri are in danger.

347
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:37,564
They are under attack from Anubis.

348
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:07,177
- I assume you were briefed?
- Briefly.

349
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:10,430
The target is Abydos,
the closest planet with a Stargate.

350
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:14,726
You know our simulations for opening the
hyperspace window were done in space?

351
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:19,106
- We have to leave the atmosphere.
- We have to leave the ground first.

352
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:22,776
- It'll fly, Colonel. I bet my life on it.
- Wanna come with?

353
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,362
Love to, but I'm needed here.

354
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,740
Yes. Yes, you are.

355
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,251
Even if we do manage
to contact the Asgard,

356
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,920
there's a chance
they won't be able to help us.

357
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:44,923
What's your point, Carter?

358
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:48,093
I guess I don't have one beyond that, sir.

359
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,262
Thank you.

360
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:59,438
- You're missing the point.
- Can I have a minute?

361
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:02,399
I wish I had one.
Carter and O'Neill are taking off.

362
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:05,152
- That's what this is about.
- What do you mean?

363
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:09,198
I'm no scientist, but I have studied
all the research done on naquadria,

364
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:12,701
and Carter allowed me to see
the specifications on the X- 302.

365
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:15,287
- And?
- It's not gonna work.

366
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,999
Really? That's just what I was saying.
Who are you?

367
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:22,586
- Jonas Quinn.
- The alien with the wacky naqahdah.

368
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,088
Naquadria. You are?

369
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:27,925
McKay. Scientist. Earth.

370
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:34,139
General... the instability of the naquadria

371
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:38,852
increases exponentially as you attempt
to extract more energy out of it.

372
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:41,063
This is even worse than I thought.

373
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:44,358
- If you allow this test to proceed...
- This is not a test.

374
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:47,236
If the X- 302 fails,
this planet will be destroyed.

375
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:50,572
- I understand your position.
- It's not just my position.

376
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:53,700
You stand to suffer the consequences
with everyone else.

377
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:57,496
If either of you have a more prudent
suggestion on halting this crisis,

378
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:59,456
I'm willing to hearing it.

379
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,459
Otherwise, I suggest
we all cross our fingers

380
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:06,421
and hope Major Carter
and Colonel O'Neill can reach help.

381
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:15,722
- Cross our fingers?
- An expression of desire for good luck.

382
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:18,392
- Really?
- It's ridiculous, huh?

383
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:36,368
- Navigation.
- Check.

384
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:39,371
Oxygen pressure. Temperature control.

385
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:43,041
- All check.
- Inertial dampeners.

386
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:49,298
Cool. And check.

387
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,010
- Engines.
- All check.

388
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:58,223
- Phasers?
- Sorry, sir. All systems operational.

389
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:08,734
Too bad we can't drive across
the galaxy. This handles like a Cadillac.

390
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:11,236
Colonel, Major, this is Hammond.

391
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,573
Jonas Quinn has voiced
some concern about this mission

392
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:17,868
regarding the instability of the naquadria.

393
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:22,664
Sir, the simulations we ran
anticipated every conceivable scenario.

394
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:25,876
It's the inconceivable ones
I'm concerned about.

395
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:28,504
The X- 302 has hundreds
of safety mechanisms

396
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:32,049
to compensate for anything
that can go wrong.

397
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:35,219
Arming ejection system.

398
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:38,347
That's good, that's good. That's funny.

399
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,266
Mission Command,
all systems go, from Abydos One.

400
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,685
Copy that, Abydos One.
Good luck.

401
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:53,987
Well... here we go.

402
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:19,054
- We have liftoff.
- Climbing.

403
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:22,057
Velocity approaching Mach 2.

404
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,017
10, 000 metres.

405
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:27,396
- Mach 3.
- Mission Command, over.

406
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:31,024
- Looks good from here, Abydos One.
- Abydos One, over.

407
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:41,785
Anubis has a weapon that uses
one Stargate to destroy another.

408
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:45,289
If my information is correct,
the attack has already begun.

409
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:48,417
- We cannot warn them.
- That is why I brought a ship.

410
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,837
If the attack has begun,
a warning will do little good.

411
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,924
- We must find a way to stop it.
- I do not know the weapon's location.

412
00:36:56,008 --> 00:37:00,971
Anubis has grown powerful, but still
only defends a small handful of planets.

413
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:03,849
If one of those Stargates
cannot be contacted...

414
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:07,561
It is most likely the origin of the attack.

415
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:12,232
Let us hope it is one of the planets
to which I can remember the sequence.

416
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:21,116
Preparing for main rocket- engine burn.

417
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,413
Roger that. We'll re- establish
contact after you exit the atmosphere.

418
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:28,999
Engaging rocket engine.

419
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:56,443
This is Abydos One.
Do you read?

420
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,779
Loud and clear, Abydos One.

421
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:02,825
Altitude: 500 kilometres and rising.

422
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,661
Velocity: 40, 000 kilometres per hour.

423
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:10,916
I'm entering the coordinates
in the hyperspace generator.

424
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:18,006
- Roger that, Abydos One.
- Godspeed, Colonel, Major, from us all.

425
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,717
Thank you, sir.

426
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:24,972
- Let's do this.
- Engaging hyperspace window.

427
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:40,571
Abydos One, do you read?
We're still receiving your radio signal.

428
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,407
- Carter?
- I don't know, sir.

429
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,453
Mission Command,
we missed the window.

430
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:49,997
Please explain.

431
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,919
The autopilot engaged and we veered
off course. Should we try again?

432
00:38:56,003 --> 00:39:01,258
Negative. Return to base for
further evaluation. Mission failure.

433
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:05,137
I hate hearing that.

434
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:19,443
Colonel, Major. Glad to see you're OK.

435
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:22,029
For the moment, sir.

436
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:26,742
They're still analysing the flight data
recorder, but it looks like a 605- 3 error.

437
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:31,330
- Forgive me?
- It's the one after 605- 2, sir.

438
00:39:33,582 --> 00:39:37,836
The X- 302 couldn't get a lock
on its destination, so it auto- aborted.

439
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,923
It's one of the built- in safety features.

440
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:44,384
- What went wrong?
- The hyperspace window was unstable.

441
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:49,598
We thought we'd compensated for the
energy fluctuations, but apparently not.

442
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:52,142
I don't think you can.

443
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:56,730
Apparently, Carter and I
could have been torn asunder.

444
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:58,732
The possibility was remote.

445
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:01,652
More likely is transportation
to an unknown location

446
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,947
with limited fuel, oxygen,
and no way of getting back.

447
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:09,451
- Can this problem be resolved?
- We don't understand why it exists yet.

448
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:14,915
You're lucky. There's no telling what
an unstable hyperspace window could do.

449
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:17,793
The bottom line is, we're on our own.

450
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:29,054
Hey. How come you're not downstairs
with the rest of the eggheads?

451
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:32,641
Not that you're... an egghead.

452
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:38,188
Well, you are, actually.

453
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:42,192
But in a good way.

454
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:48,824
I couldn't think down there. They all
kept looking at me for the answer.

455
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:54,496
Well, you do have a penchant for
pulling brilliant ideas out of your butt.

456
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,957
Head.

457
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,043
Out of your head, when we need them.

458
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:03,714
- Not this time.
- You've still got two days to work on it.

459
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:07,426
Sir, I don't think I could solve this
if I had a couple of years.

460
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:09,970
Carter, am I sensing fear in your voice?

461
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:14,725
- Yes, actually. A lot of fear.
- Well, stop it. You're making me nervous.

462
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:17,519
What about you, sir? Any ideas?

463
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:22,733
I mean, sometimes you have a way
of seeing things at... at their simplest.

464
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:27,154
Thank you.

465
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:34,203
I'm gonna go eat some cake.

466
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:37,831
Think I'll join you.

467
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:54,932
We're experiencing
a widespread loss of power, sir.

468
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:10,572
I am Anubis.

469
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:13,617
Looks like a hologram projection.

470
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:19,665
Humans of the Tauri,
your end of days finally approaches.

471
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:23,752
There will be no mercy.

472
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:26,964
Come on. Who talks like that?

473
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:32,344
Sir, this is Asgard technology.
He must have downloaded it from Thor.

474
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:35,848
You will bow to my awesome power.

475
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:40,936
There is nothing that can stop
the destruction I bring upon you.

476
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:45,190
Prepare to meet your doom.

477
00:42:50,154 --> 00:42:51,822
Oh, please!

478
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:02,124
