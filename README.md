# Sandbox

Purpose of this repository is to be a collection of demos, tutorials and
experiments.

## Structure Review

Directory structure must be reviewed and updated.

* [ ] `java-demos`
* [ ] `java-tpoint`
* [ ] `python-demos`
* [ ] `python-encrypt`
* [ ] `python-udemy`

## Rules

* Every sub-project has its own directory under the root.
* Name of the sub-project directory is prefixed with the language or technology
  name.
* Dash `-` and underscore `_` characters are to be used in names of the
  directories, e.g. `python-demos`, `python-demos/hello_world/hello_world.py`.
* Every sub-project directory contains `README.md` file with a basic
  documentation.
