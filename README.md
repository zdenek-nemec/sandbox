## Rules

* Every sub-project has its own directory under the root and its name follows language/technology conventions.
    * Java: Pascal case with space characters ` ` removed
    * Python: Lower case with dash `-` character used instead of a space ` `
* Structure under the sub-project directory follows language/technology conventions and allows to be imported to IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, etc.).
* Every sub-project directory contains the `README.md` file with a basic documentation.
