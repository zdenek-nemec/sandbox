Purpose of this repository is to be a collection of demos, tutorials and
experiments.

## TODO: Structure Review

Directory structure must be reviewed and updated.

* [x] `java-demos`
* [ ] `java-tpoint`
* [ ] `python-demos`
* [ ] `python-encrypt`
* [ ] `python-udemy`

## Structure

| Directory        | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `java-demos`     | Java demos  |
| `java-tpoint`    | ...         |
| `python-demos`   | ...         |
| `python-encrypt` | ...         |
| `python-udemy`   | ...         |

## Rules

* Every sub-project has its own directory under the root.
* Name of the sub-project directory is prefixed with the language or technology
  name.
* Dash `-` character is to be used in names of the directories, e.g.
  `python-demos`, `python-demos/hello-world/hello_world.py`.
* Every sub-project directory contains `README.md` file with a basic
  documentation.
